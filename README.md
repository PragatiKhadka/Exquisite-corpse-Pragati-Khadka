### Flowers
Flowers are **beautiful**.  
They simply bring *smile* on my face.  
As they are used for many different purposes, life without flowers is incomplete.  

Many different flowers are growing **beautifully** and strongly in this world  
Taking their roots in the earth,  
Sprouting, blooming , pollination by birds and insects, living on in spite of rain, wind and storms.

Flower smells **good**

Flower smells good.
**flowers** are every where.  
They **light up** the world.  
They make me **happy**.  
  

Many different flowers are growing **beautifully** and strongly in this world.  
Taking their roots in the earth, sprouting, blooming.  
Pollination by birds and insects, living on despite of rain, wind and storms.
