### Flowers

Flowers are **beautiful**.  
They simply bring *smile* on my face.  
As they are used for many different purposes, life without flowers is incomplete.  
Many different flowers are growing **beautifully** and strongly in this world  
Taking their roots in the earth,  
Sprouting, blooming , pollination by birds and insects, living on in spite of rain, wind and storms.

Flower smells **good**
Flower are **colorful**

Flower smells good.
**flowers** are every where.  
They **light up** the world.  
They make me **happy**.

In different seasons, we have different flowers.  
**Orchid** in spring  
**Lotus** in summer  
**Chrysanthemum** in autumn  
and **Plum Blossom** in winter
