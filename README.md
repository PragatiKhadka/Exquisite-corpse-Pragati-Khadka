### Flowers

Flowers are **beautiful**.  
They simply bring *smile* on my face.  
As they are used for many different purposes, life without flowers is incomplete.  
Many different flowers are growing **beautifully**  
Taking their roots in the earth,sprouting, blooming, pollination by birds and insects,  
Living on in spite of rain, wind and storms.
