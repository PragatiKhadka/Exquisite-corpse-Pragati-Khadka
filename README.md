### Flowers
Flowers are **beautiful**.  
They simply bring *smile* on my face.  
As they are used for many different purposes, life without flowers is incomplete.  
Many different flowers are growing **beautifully** and strongly in this world  
Taking their roots in the earth,  
Sprouting, blooming , pollination by birds and insects, living on in spite of rain, wind and storms.
